Consider a machine that works as follows. If it is up at the beginning of a day, it stays up at the
beginning of the next day with probability p and fails with probability 1 - p. It takes exactly 2
days for the repairs, at the end of which the machine is as good as new. Let X n be the state of the
machine at the beginning of day n, where the state is 0 if the machine has just failed, 1 if 1 day’s
worth of repair work is done on it, and 2 if it is up. Show that {X n : n ≥ 0} is a DTMC, and
display its transition probability matrix. Suppose the machine is initially up. Compute the
probability that the machine is up at times n = 5; 10; 15; and 20. (Assume p = 0.95)
